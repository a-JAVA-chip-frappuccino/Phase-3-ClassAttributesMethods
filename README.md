# Phase 3 Lecture 3: Class Attributes and Class Methods

## Objectives

By the end of today's lecture, you will be able to create class attributes and class methods (aggregate methods).

## Lesson Plan

0. Run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment.
1. Define a class Book with three properties: title, author, page_count
2. Define a class attribute that stores all objects.
    - What distinguishes a class attribute from an instance attribute?
    - When should we add to this?
3. Define a class method `get_all_books` that returns all books.
    - How many ways can you define a class method?
4. Define a class method `get_first_book` that returns the first book in the list.
5. Define a class method `get_avg_page_count` that returns the mean/average page count across all books.
6. Define a class method `get_longest_book` that returns the longest book.

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow's lecture will walk through how to combine multiple classes and objects.
